# Docker.

This is a complete overview of Dockers.

## Q1. What is the difference between Dockers and VMs?
	Dockers allows us to have containers that can share/run one host OS whereas VMs have their own guest OS. Multiple containers can share one OS but multiple VMs need seprate and own guest OS.

	1. Containers runs much faster than VMs
	2. Less disk space and other resources
	3. Does not need full OS
	4. Ease of Deployment and Testing.


Docker Image: It is a template for creating an enviornment of your choice also a snapshot.
	Snapshots: It allows us to go back to last image or otther versions of the image in case we make mistakes.
